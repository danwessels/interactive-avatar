## âœ¨ Features

### Avatar Animations

The avatar features the following visual 'emotional' states that reflect its current activity.

- **Idle State**: Gentle floating animation with a sleeping face that displays when the avatar is minimised and not in use.
- **Listening State**: Gentle floating animation with smiling face which indicates that the avatar is awake (not longer minimised) but is not actively engaged in conversation.
- **Thinking State**: Bouncing animation reminiscent of a loader that indicates the avatar has just received a prompt from the user in the chat screen and is thinking.
- **Speaking State**: Animated 'talking' mouth indicates that the avatar is done thinking and is responding to your latest message in the chat screen.

### ðŸŽ¯ Keyboard Navigation

The following keyboard shortcuts are supported.

| Key           | Action                                        |

| `S`           | Open Settings                                 |
| `0`           | Return to Idle                                |
| `Escape`      | Close current view (or return to awake state) |
| `Enter`       | Send chat message                             |
| `Shift+Enter` | New line in chat (multi-line message)         |
| `Tab`         | Navigate between interactive elements         |

## Current limitations

This is just a demo, so it has limited functionality. Currently, Lil' Buddy will always respond with the same hardcoded answer after being asked a question. 
In addition, the configurable settings are for demonstration purposes only and do not currently have an effect on the rest of the app.
