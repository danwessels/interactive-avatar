# Interactive Avatar - Lil' Buddy

An interactive React application featuring an animated avatar with mocked functionality that includes live chat and customizable settings. Built with a modern glassmorphism style, and a focus and on accessibility and mobile responsiveness.

## âœ¨ Features

### Avatar Animations

The avatar features the following visual states that reflect its current activity.

- **Idle State**: Gentle floating animation with a sleeping face that shows when the avatar is minimised and not in use.
- **Listening State**: Gentle floating animation with smiling face which indicates that the avatar is awake (not longer minimised) but is not actively engaged in conversation.
- **Thinking State**: Bouncing animation reminiscent of a loader that indicates the avatar has just received a prompt from the user and is thinking.
- **Speaking State**: Animated 'talking' mouth indicates that the avatar is done thinking and is responding to your latest message.
